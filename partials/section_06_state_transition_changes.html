<h2 id="state-transition-changes">6. State Transition Changes</h2>
<p>After a block passes static validation but before pre-charging the sender's balance, execution proceeds with a block-level state snapshot mechanism to handle execution validation.</p>

<h4>Block Execution with State Snapshots</h4>
<p>The execution process uses block-level state snapshots to enable execution rollback if necessary:</p>

<div class="code-block">
    <div class="code-header">
        <span>Block Execution with Snapshots</span>
        <div class="toggle-btn" onclick="return toggleCodeBlock(this, event)" style="cursor:pointer">âˆ’</div>
    </div>
    <div class="code-content">
        <pre><code class="language-python">def process_transactions(...) -> None:
        take_block_level_snapshot(block_env.state)
    
        decoded_transactions = [decode_transaction(tx) for tx in transactions]

        # Charge senders the maximum fees upfront
        # ...
        </code></pre>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>Key Execution Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Block-Level Snapshot</strong>: A snapshot of the entire state is taken before any transaction execution begins</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Charging Senders</strong>: Sender account balances are updated based on pre-validation results</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction Execution</strong>: All transactions are processed following existing rules</li>
    <li><strong>Gas Validation</strong>: After execution, the actual gas used is verified against the declared value in the block header</li>
    <li><strong>State Management</strong>: If a gas mismatch is detected, execution is rolled back using the block-level snapshot</li>
    <li><strong>Output Calculation</strong>: Execution outputs are calculated for verification in subsequent blocks</li>
</ol>

    <div class="rationale-title">Rationale for State Snapshot Architecture</div>
    <div class="rationale-content">
        <p>The block-level snapshot mechanism provides an efficient way to revert execution when necessary. This approach allows clients to roll back the entire block's execution if the actual gas used does not match the declared gas in the header, without invalidating the block structure itself.</p>
        <p>This provides two key benefits:
        <ol>
            <li>It allows validators to attest to blocks before execution is complete</li>
            <li>It ensures execution is eventually performed correctly, with economic penalties for incorrect gas declarations</li>
        </ol>

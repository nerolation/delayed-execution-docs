<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction and Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7886">Delayed Execution</a> is a proposed update to Ethereum's block processing mechanism that separates block validation from execution. This design allows validators to attest to a block's validity without completing its execution.</p>

<h3>Key Benefits</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Block Validation:</strong> Blocks can be validated and attested without performing full execution</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Network Throughput:</strong> Removes execution from critical path, potentially enabling higher block gas limits</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Resilience:</strong> Transactions can be reverted rather than invalidating entire blocks</li>
    <li><strong>Early Attestation:</strong> Allows attestation to happen earlier in the slot, independent of execution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Concept Overview</h3>
<p>In the current Ethereum protocol, blocks must be fully executed before validators can attest to them. This requirement creates a bottleneck in the consensus process, as attestors must wait for execution results before committing their votes, limiting the network's throughput potential.</p>

<p>Delayed Execution introduces a mechanism where execution payloads can be reverted rather than invalidating the entire block. This means execution is no longer an immediate requirement for validation:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Pre-Execution Validation:</strong> Validators perform minimal checks that only require the previous state, without executing transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Attestation Execution:</strong> The actual execution of transactions happens after the block is validated and attested to.</li>
</ol>

<div class="rationale">
    <div class="rationale-title">Rationale for Header Changes</div>
    <div class="rationale-content">
        <p>By introducing a mechanism where execution payloads can be reverted rather than invalidating the entire block, execution is no longer an immediate requirement for validation. Instead, a block's validity can be determined based on its structural correctness and the upfront payment of transaction fees by senders.</p>
        <p>This allows attestation to happen earlier in the slot, independent of execution, potentially enabling higher block gas limits and shorter slot times.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Key Components</h3>
<p>Delayed Execution introduces:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Modified block header fields that reference parent block execution results</li>
    <li>Extended blockchain state tracking for verification of deferred execution outputs</li>
    <li>Static block validation that doesn't require transaction execution</li>
    <li>Pre-charging mechanism for maximum possible transaction fees</li>
    <li>Block-level state snapshot architecture for efficient execution rollback when necessary</li>
</ol>

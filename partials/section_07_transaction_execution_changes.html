<h2 id="transaction-execution-changes">7. Security Considerations</h2>
<p>Delayed execution introduces several important security aspects that must be carefully considered.</p>

<h4>Execution Correctness Guarantees</h4>
<p>The protocol ensures execution correctness through two primary mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Deferred Execution Validation</strong>: Execution outputs must match in subsequent blocks, creating a chain of verifiable execution results</li>
    <li><strong>State Rollback Mechanism</strong>: State rollback occurs if the actual gas used doesn't match the declared value, providing an economic incentive for correct gas declaration</li>
</ol>

<h4>Data Availability and Economic Incentives</h4>
<p>Block proposers must declare correct gas usage or lose transaction fees when execution is rolled back. This aligns incentives for correct gas declaration and ensures execution integrity.</p>

<p>Even when a block's execution is reverted due to incorrect gas declaration, the transaction data (calldata, access lists, and blob data) must still be stored by all nodes for syncing and block validation purposes. This requirement creates a potential attack vector where malicious actors could attempt to place large amounts of data on-chain at a reduced cost by intentionally invalidating blocks through incorrect gas declarations.</p>

    <div class="rationale-content">
        <p>This attack is not economically sustainable for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Block proposers who invalidate blocks through incorrect gas declarations lose all execution layer rewards associated with the block.</li>
            <li>The attack requires control of block production, which is a scarce resource in the consensus layer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The economic costs of forgoing block rewards significantly outweigh any potential benefits, making such attacks financially impractical under normal network conditions.</p>

<h2 id="header-field-changes">2. Header Field Changes</h2>
<p>The block header structure is extended to support delayed execution.</p>

<h4>Header Structure Changes</h4>
<p>The block header structure includes new and renamed fields:</p>

<p>The key field changes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>pre_transactions_root</code>: Represents the transactions root before execution (checked against the post-execution transactions root of the parent block)</li>
    <li><code>pre_state_root</code>: Represents the state root before execution (checked against parent block's post-execution state)</li>
    <li><code>parent_receipt_root</code>: Receipt root from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
    <li><code>parent_bloom</code>: Logs bloom from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
    <li><code>gas_used</code>: Declared gas used by transactions, validated post-execution</li>
    <li><code>parent_requests_hash</code>: Hash of requests from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
</ul>

<div class="edge-implications">
    <div class="edge-implications-title">Implications</div>
    <div class="edge-implications-content">
        <p>A block header must include all these fields to be considered valid. The <code>pre_state_root</code> must match the state root after applying the parent block's execution. The parent execution outputs must accurately reflect the previous block's execution results to maintain chain integrity.</p>
        <p>With these changes, a block no longer contains a direct commitment to its own post-execution state. Instead, the post-execution state will appear in the next block's <code>pre_state_root</code>, and other execution results will be referenced in the next block's parent fields.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="rationale">
    <div class="rationale-title">Rationale for Header Changes</div>
    <div class="rationale-content">
        <p>The core innovation of deferring execution outputs to the next block enables static verification without requiring immediate execution. The <code>pre_state_root</code> provides a cryptographically verifiable starting point for validation, while parent execution outputs create a chain of deferred execution results that maintains the integrity of the blockchain state.</p>
        <p>This approach eliminates the execution bottleneck in the validation pipeline by allowing validators to attest to a block's validity based on its structure and the pre-charged transaction fees, without waiting for execution results.</p>

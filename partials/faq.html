            <h3>What is delayed execution?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Delayed execution (EIP-7886) is a proposed update to Ethereum's block processing mechanism that separates block validation from execution. It introduces a mechanism to make execution blocks quickly verifiable through minimal checks that only require the previous state and reserving the maximum possible fees upfront, without requiring execution of the block's transactions. This enables validators to attest to a block's validity without completing its execution.</p>

            <h3>What are the key benefits of delayed execution?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Delayed execution offers several significant benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Block Validation:</strong> Blocks can be validated and attested without performing full execution</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Network Throughput:</strong> Removes execution from critical path, potentially enabling higher block gas limits</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Resilience:</strong> Payloads can be reverted rather than invalidating entire blocks</li>
                <li><strong>Early Attestation:</strong> Allows attestation to happen earlier in the slot, independent of execution</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How does delayed execution differ from the current Ethereum workflow?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The key differences between current and delayed execution workflows are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current workflow:</strong> receive block → validate header → execute all transactions → verify state root → attest</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed execution:</strong> receive block → validate header → verify parent results → pre-charge senders → attest → execute transactions later</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the current Ethereum protocol, blocks must be fully executed before validators can attest to them. This requirement creates a bottleneck in the consensus process, as attestors must wait for execution results before committing their votes. With delayed execution, a block's validity can be determined based on its structural correctness and the upfront payment of transaction fees by senders, allowing attestation to happen earlier in the slot.</p>

            <h3>What changes are made to the block header for delayed execution?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Several key changes are made to the block header:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>parent_transactions_root</code>: Represents the root of the transactions from the parent block (checked against the block's transactions)</li>
                <li><code>pre_state_root</code>: Represents the state root before execution (checked against parent block's post-execution state)</li>
                <li><code>parent_receipt_root</code>: Receipt root from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
                <li><code>parent_bloom</code>: Logs bloom from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
                <li><code>parent_requests_hash</code>: Hash of requests from the parent block (deferred execution output)</li>
                <li><code>parent_execution_reverted</code>: Indicates if the parent block's execution was reverted (deferred execution output)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These changes enable a block to reference its parent's execution outputs rather than its own, allowing static validation without executing the current block's transactions.</p>

            <h3>How does validation work in delayed execution?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Pre-execution validation involves several key steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Validating the block header against its parent header</li>
                <li>Ensuring parent execution outputs in the header match the chain's tracked values</li>
                <li>Verifying the pre-state root matches the current state root</li>
                <li>Validating all transactions for signature correctness, sender balances, and nonces</li>
                <li>Verifying gas and blob gas usage doesn't exceed protocol limits</li>
                <li>Pre-charging senders for the maximum possible gas fees</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During this process, sender balances are reserved to ensure they have sufficient funds to cover maximum possible gas fees plus transaction value. This validation can be performed without executing transactions, enabling earlier block attestation.</p>

            <h3>What happens if gas usage doesn't match the declared amount?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If the actual gas used after execution doesn't match the declared gas in the block header, the entire execution is rolled back using a block-level state snapshot. The protocol takes a snapshot of the entire state before any transaction execution begins, and if a gas mismatch is detected, it restores the state to its pre-block condition.</p>
            <p>This creates an economic incentive for correct gas declaration, as block proposers who incorrectly declare gas usage will lose all transaction fees when execution is rolled back. However, the block itself remains valid from a consensus perspective, maintaining chain integrity while ensuring execution accuracy.</p>

            <h3>How does pre-charging senders work?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Pre-charging senders involves tracking and deducting the maximum possible gas fees from sender balances during block validation to ensure they have sufficient funds for their transactions. The validation process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculates maximum possible gas fees for each transaction</li>
                <li>Tracks sender balances and nonces in memory</li>
                <li>Ensures senders have sufficient balance for maximum fees</li>
                <li>Deducts maximum fees from tracked balances</li>
                <li>Updates nonces in the tracking structure</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What security considerations are there with delayed execution?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Delayed execution maintains security through several mechanisms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Deferred Execution Validation:</strong> Execution outputs must match in subsequent blocks, creating a chain of verifiable execution results</li>
                <li><strong>State Rollback Mechanism:</strong> State rollback occurs if gas used doesn't match declared value, providing economic incentives for correct gas declaration</li>
                <li><strong>Data Availability:</strong> Even for reverted executions, transaction data must be stored by all nodes for syncing and validation</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Disincentives:</strong> Block proposers who incorrectly declare gas usage lose all execution layer rewards</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While there's a potential attack vector where malicious actors could attempt to place data on-chain at reduced cost by intentionally invalidating blocks, this is not economically sustainable. The costs of forgoing block rewards significantly outweigh potential benefits, making such attacks financially impractical.</p>
